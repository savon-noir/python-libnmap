libnmap.diff
==============

Using libnmap.diff module
-------------------------

This modules enables the user to diff two NmapObjects: NmapService, NmapHost, NmapReport.

The constructor returns a NmapDiff object which he can then use to call its inherited methods:

    - added()
    - removed()
    - changed()
    - unchanged()

Those methods return a python set() of keys which have been changed/added/removed/unchanged from one
object to another.
The keys of each objects could be found in the implementation of the get_dict() methods of the compared objects.

The example below is a heavy version of going through all nested objects to see what has changed after a diff::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    from libnmap.parser import NmapParser
    
    rep1 = NmapParser.parse_fromfile('libnmap/test/files/1_hosts.xml')
    rep2 = NmapParser.parse_fromfile('libnmap/test/files/1_hosts_diff.xml')
    
    rep1_items_changed = rep1.diff(rep2).changed()
    changed_host_id = rep1_items_changed.pop().split('::')[1]
    
    changed_host1 = rep1.get_host_byid(changed_host_id)
    changed_host2 = rep2.get_host_byid(changed_host_id)
    host1_items_changed = changed_host1.diff(changed_host2).changed()
    
    changed_service_id = host1_items_changed.pop().split('::')[1]
    changed_service1 = changed_host1.get_service_byid(changed_service_id)
    changed_service2 = changed_host2.get_service_byid(changed_service_id)
    service1_items_changed = changed_service1.diff(changed_service2).changed()
    
    for diff_attr in service1_items_changed:
        print "diff({0}, {1}) [{2}:{3}] [{4}:{5}]".format(changed_service1.id,
                                                         changed_service2.id,
                                                         diff_attr,
                                                         getattr(changed_service1, diff_attr),
                                                         diff_attr,
                                                         getattr(changed_service2, diff_attr))

This outputs the following line::

   (pydev)$ python /tmp/z.py
   diff(tcp.3306, tcp.3306) [state:open] [state:filtered]
   (pydev)$

Of course, the above code is quite ugly and heavy but the idea behind diff was to be as generic as possible in order to
let the user of the lib defines its own algorithms to extract the data.

A less manual and more clever approach would be to recursively retrieve the changed attributes and values of nested objects.
Below, you will find a small code example doing it

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/diff_sample2.py

This code will output the following::

    ~ NmapReport: started at 1361737906 hosts up 2/2 hosts_total: 1 => 2
    ~ NmapReport: started at 1361737906 hosts up 2/2 commandline: nmap -sT -vv -oX 1_hosts.xml localhost => nmap -sS -vv -oX 2_hosts.xml localhost scanme.nmap.org
    ~ NmapReport: started at 1361737906 hosts up 2/2 hosts_up: 1 => 2
    ~ NmapService: [closed 25/tcp smtp ()] state: open => closed
    + NmapService: [open 23/tcp telnet ()]
    - NmapService: [open 111/tcp rpcbind ()]
    ~ NmapReport: started at 1361737906 hosts up 2/2 scan_type: connect => syn
    ~ NmapReport: started at 1361737906 hosts up 2/2 elapsed: 0.14 => 134.36
    + NmapHost: [74.207.244.221 (scanme.nmap.org scanme.nmap.org) - up]

Note that, in the above example, lines prefixed with:

    1. '~' means values changed
    2. '+ means values were added
    3. '-' means values were removed
